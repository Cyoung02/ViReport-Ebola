# Variations in Tree Dating

In this directory, I include several different molecular epidemiological analyses of the Ebola Virus using varying tree dating tools. I will use:
* [TreeDater](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/DatingTools/TreeDater) (default)
* [LogDate](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/DatingTools/LogDate)
* [LSD2](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/DatingTools/LSD2)

The rest of the pipeline will remain as the default used by ViReport.
