# ViReport-Ebola
This repository contains several different molecular epidemiological analyses of Zaire Ebolavirus using [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport). I will be running ViReport with varying tools to see how they affect the reconstruction of epidemiological data from molecular sequences, in hopes of gaining more insights into the strengths and weakenesses of the tools used. In particular, I plan to analyze the effects of:

* [Varying phylogenetic inference tools](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/PhyloTools)
* [Varying tree dating tools](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/PhyloTools)

All sequences are publicly available from GenBank, and must have a minimum sequence length of 18,000 base pairs.

The scope of this analysis may increase to encompass different steps in the ViReport pipeline later.
Note: ViReport is still in early development and I am working on getting it working, so analyses will not be complete. This repository will update as I progress.
