# ViReport-Ebola
This repository contains several different molecular epidemiological analyses of Ebola Virus using [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport). I will be running ViReport with varying tools to see how they affect the reconstruction of epidemiological data from molecular data, in hopes of gaining more insights into the strengths and weakenesses of said tools. In particular, I plan to analyze the effects of:

* [Varying phylogenetic inference tools](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/PhyloTools)
* [Varying tree dating tools](https://github.com/Cyoung02/ViReport-Ebola/tree/master/PhyloTools)

The scope of this analysis may increase to encompass different steps in the ViReport pipeline later.

Note: ViReport is not yet a finished product and I am currently in the process of getting it running. This repository will update as I progress.
