# Variations in Phylogenetic Inference

In this directory, I include several different molecular epidemiological analyses of the Ebola Virus using varying phylogenetic inference tools. I will use:
* IQ-Tree
* FastTree
* RAx-ML
* PhyML

The rest of the pipeline will remain as the default used by ViReport.
